[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unibas-gravis/scalismo-faces.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unibas-gravis/scalismo-faces)

This is a framework for shape modeling and model-based image analysis in scala.
It is based on the [scalismo](https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo)
library for shape modelling. It originates from the [Graphics
and Vision](http://gravis.cs.unibas.ch) research group at the [University of
Basel](http://www.unibas.ch), Switzerland.

The library contains tools for image processing, rendering and handling of the Morphable Model. A tutorial on how to use this software and about the concepts of Analysis-by-Synthesis face image analysis will soon be available from the University of Basel. Until then, enjoy the shape modelling online course about scalismo at http://shapemodelling.cs.unibas.ch/.

The library is initially started at a very basic level. More contents will be added when the tutorial from the University of Basel will be available (expected Feb/Mar 2017). We will add rendering, handling of the Morphable Model and also model fitting capability. The current state is still under heavy development and subject to frequent changes. While being built up, we resort to a simple feature branching model and develop on the master branch with tagged releases.

Usage
-----

### sbt

Add the dependency to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.unibas.cs.gravis" %% "scalismo-faces" % "0.4.1"
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("unibas-gravis", "maven")
```

Currently also add the scalismo native libs as an explicit dependency:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.unibas.cs.gravis" % "scalismo-native-all" % "3.0.0"
```

### Getting Started

- Tutorial from the University of Basel: *coming soon*
- Create a checkerboard image and save it to disk:

```scala
import scalismo.color.RGB
import scalismo.image.{PixelImage, PixelImageIO}
import java.io.File

val checkerboard = PixelImage(128, 128, {(x, y) => if ((x+y)%2 == 0) RGB.White else RGB.Black})
PixelImageIO.write(checkerboard, new File("checkerboard.png")).get
```
(you can open an appropriate Scala REPL via `sbt console`)
