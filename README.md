[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unibas-gravis/scalismo-faces.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unibas-gravis/scalismo-faces)

[![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/unibas-gravis/maven/scalismo-faces/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/unibas-gravis/maven/scalismo-faces/_latestVersion)
 
This is a framework for shape modeling and model-based image analysis in scala.
It is based on the [scalismo](https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo)
library for shape modelling. It originates from the [Graphics
and Vision](http://gravis.cs.unibas.ch) research group at the [University of
Basel](http://www.unibas.ch), Switzerland.

The library contains tools for image processing, rendering and handling of the Morphable Model. A tutorial on how to use this software and about the concepts of Analysis-by-Synthesis face image analysis is available from the University of Basel under http://gravis.dmi.unibas.ch/PMM/.

Usage
-----

### sbt

Add the dependency to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.unibas.cs.gravis" %% "scalismo-faces" % "0.90.0"
```

### Getting Started

- The following code creates a checkerboard image and save it to disk:

```scala
import scalismo.color.RGB
import scalismo.faces.image.PixelImage
import scalismo.faces.io.PixelImageIO
import java.io.File

object ChessExample extends App {
  val checkerboard = PixelImage(128, 128, {(x, y) => if ((x+y)%2 == 0) RGB.White else RGB.Black})
  PixelImageIO.write(checkerboard, new File("checkerboard.png")).get
}
```
To execute it place the code in a file `src/main/scala/ChessExample.scala` and run `sbt run` from your project directory where you have the `build.sbt` file with at least the lines described under the former point **sbt**.
