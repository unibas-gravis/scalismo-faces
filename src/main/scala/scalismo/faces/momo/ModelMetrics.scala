  /*
  * The implementation of these metrices is inspired from :
  * Styner, Martin A., et al. "Evaluation of 3D correspondence methods for model building." Information processing in medical imaging. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2003.
  *
  * an Implementation for the shape part only can also be found in scalismo/src/main/scala/scalismo/statisticalmodel/dataset/ModelMetrics.scala
  *
  *
  * For simplicity here its only implemented for data in correspondence (it would be possible only for the specificity to implement it without correspondence using closestpoints)
  *
  * Specificity:
  * how close the model remains to the category of shapes it is supposed to represent
  * The general idea is as follows :
  * 1 - sample a shape from the mesh model
  * 2-  compute the average mesh distance  of the sample to all elements of the given sequence of meshes and select the minimum distance
  * These steps are then repeated nbSamples times and the average value is returned.
  *
  * Generalization:
  * how well the model can represent unseen data
  * For every mesh in the test data, we project the mesh into the model (that is find the closest shape in the model space to the given mesh) and compute the average mesh distance between the mesh and the projection.
  * To be able to perform the projection, it is important that the data collection is in correspondence with the model.
  * The returned value is a scala.util.Try containing the average over all test data in case of success, or an Exception otherwise
